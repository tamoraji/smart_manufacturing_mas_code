About Dataset
The Intelligent Manufacturing Dataset for Predictive Optimization is a dataset designed for research in smart manufacturing, AI-driven process optimization, and predictive maintenance. It simulates real-time sensor data from industrial machines, incorporating 6G network slicing for enhanced communication and resource allocation.

Key Features:
✔ Industrial IoT Sensor Data – Temperature, vibration, power consumption, etc.
✔ 6G Network Performance Metrics – Latency, packet loss, and communication efficiency.
✔ Production Efficiency Indicators – Defect rate, predictive maintenance score, error rate.
✔ Target Column (Efficiency_Status) – Classifies manufacturing efficiency as High, Medium, or Low based on performance metrics.

Applications:
🔹 AI-based predictive maintenance
🔹 Resource allocation optimization in 6G-enabled smart factories
🔹 Real-time anomaly detection in industrial production
🔹 Deep learning model training for intelligent manufacturing systems

This dataset serves as a benchmark for AI and deep learning applications in Industry 4.0 and 6G network-integrated manufacturing systems.
