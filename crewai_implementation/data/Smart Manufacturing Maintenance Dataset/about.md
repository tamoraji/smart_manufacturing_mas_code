About Dataset
This dataset supports research on predictive maintenance and decision support in smart manufacturing systems. The dataset combines real-time sensor measurements, maintenance cost factors, and decision variables to prioritize equipment servicing based on failure risk and operational constraints.

The framework uses cloud computing to improve system scalability and responsiveness by synchronizing virtual asset models with real-time sensor and inspection data

Researchers and practitioners can use this dataset to explore proactive maintenance scheduling, asset health diagnostics, and intelligent factory management.

⭐ Key Features
Real-Time Sensor Data: Includes temperature, vibration, pressure, and acoustic signals from simulated manufacturing equipment.

Maintenance Decision Criteria: Factors like inspection duration, technician availability, and downtime cost to support MCDM.

Failure Probability Score: Computed feature for training predictive models (range: 0–1).

Maintenance Priority Label: Target variable (High = 1, Medium = 2, Low = 3) based on failure likelihood and operational risk.
